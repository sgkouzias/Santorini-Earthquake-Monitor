This Streamlit app visualizes seismic activity data near Santorini, Greece. It fetches earthquake data from the [Geophysics Department of the University of Athens](http://www.geophysics.geol.uoa.gr/stations/maps/recent_gr.html), filters it for events near Santorini, and displays a plot of earthquake magnitude over time.

## Features

- Fetches real-time earthquake data.
- Filters data for events near Santorini.
- Plots earthquake magnitude over time.
- Shows a polynomial trendline to visualize the overall trend of seismic activity.
